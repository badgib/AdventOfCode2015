## ADVENT OF CODE 2015 ##
...in late 2024... because why not...

### DAY ONE ###

Easy one, just increment value on \( and decrement it on \) counting where it lands on. Second problem not really harder, just add `if floor == -1: print(i+1)` and we get the answer.

### DAY TWO ###

Another easy day, just a bit of math on lines. Calculating area and length. Not much to see here, move along, citizen!

### DAY THREE ###

That one was a tad harder but second problem required just a slight modification of the code from the first one so it wasn't ultimately that hard. Just some ifs and math.

### DAY FOUR ###

This one required less code but more time because it had to calculate MD5 hashes. Second problem was just a longer calculation, requiring almost no changes to code.

### DAY FIVE ###

This day was kinda stupid... or I am ;) Anywho my math was apparently wrong and only after googling and converting JS answer to python I got the answer I was missing \(my was one less than it was supposed, go figure\).

### DAY SIX ###

Day six sux. Or rather - my implementation did. After a rewrite it's now way faster and sane too. Doing it with a list of points is terribly inefficient. Second problem was pretty much as simple as first one, just needed a bit more math in there.

### DAY SEVEN ###

And they say seven is lucky... Heh. This one took me by surprise and I must admit, I had to look around for answers but it was a fun excersize nonetheless. Because of all the possible branching it required some creative solutions. Second part was tricky but ultimately not too hard, all things considered.
